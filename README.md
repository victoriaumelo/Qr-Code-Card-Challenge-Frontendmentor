## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

```html
<link rel="icon" sizes="32x32" type="image/png" href="images/favicon-32x32.png"> for adding icons/logos to head of html
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
    display: grid;
    justify-items: center;
    align-content: center;
} for centering content
```

### Continued development

- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### Useful resources

- [W3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox_container.asp) - This helped me learn how to use justify-content and text-direction. I really liked this site and will use it going forward.
- [Css froggy game](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand CSS Flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
